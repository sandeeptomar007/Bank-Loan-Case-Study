# Bank-Loan-Case-Study

## Project Description

The project aims to analyze loan application data from a consumer finance company. The objective is to identify patterns and factors that indicate whether a client is likely to have difficulty paying their loan installments. 

By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), we can uncover insights that will help the company minimize the risk of loan default and make informed decisions regarding loan approvals.

## Approach

The analysis will involve the following steps:

1. Data understanding: We will examine the provided datasets, including "application_data.csv" and "previous_application.csv", along with the data dictionary in "columns_description.csv". This will give us an understanding of the variables and their meanings.

2. Missing data treatment: We will identify missing values in the datasets and decide on appropriate methods to deal with them. This may involve removing columns with excessive missing values or replacing missing values with suitable alternatives.

3. Outlier identification: We will explore the datasets to identify any outliers. Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the majority and may have a significant impact on the analysis. We will not remove outliers for this exercise but rather focus on understanding their presence and potential implications.

4. Data imbalance analysis: We will examine the balance between different classes in the dataset. If there is a significant imbalance, we will calculate the ratio of data imbalance to understand the distribution.

5. Univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analysis: We will perform these analyses to gain insights into the relationship between variables and the target variable. This will involve exploring individual variables, segmenting the data based on the target variable, and examining relationships between variables.

6. Correlation analysis: We will calculate correlations between variables for both the clients with payment difficulties and all other cases. By segmenting the data based on the target variable, we can identify the top correlations within each segment and derive insights from them.

## Tech-Stack Used

The analysis will be conducted using Microsoft Excel (2021)  or Jupyter Notebook. These tools provide a wide range of functionalities for data analysis, including data manipulation, visualization, and statistical calculations.

## Finding Insights

1. Identify the missing data and use appropriate methods to deal with it.
2. Identify if there are outliers in the dataset.
3. Identify if there is a data imbalance in the data. Find the ratio of data imbalance.
4. Explain the results of univariate, segmented univariate, bivariate analysis, etc.
5. Find the top 10 correlations for the Client with payment difficulties and all other cases (Target variable).
6. Include visualizations and summarize the most important results in the presentation.

## Result

By performing EDA and analyzing the loan application data, I will achieve a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing loan default. 

The insights gained from the analysis will assist the company in minimizing the risk of loan default, making appropriate decisions regarding loan approvals, and optimizing its portfolio and risk assessment strategies. 

The project will provide valuable knowledge and actionable insights to enhance the company's lending practices and improve its overall business performance.
